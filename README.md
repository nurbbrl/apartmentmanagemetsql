The apartment site management program provides services for the charging of services such as dues accrued to the apartments in the site, hot water, cold water, pool maintenance, etc. These debts charged are accrued to the flat owner or the flat tenant according to the decision of the site management. Each debt accrued has a due date. If payment is not made by this due date, an interest of 0.15 of the main debt amount is applied every day.
